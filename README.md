# Voting App by edlobox

## Objective:
Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to **[this page](https://yasser-nightlife-app.herokuapp.com/)** and deploy it to Heroku.

Note that for each project, you should create a new GitHub repository and a new Heroku project. If you can't remember how to do this, revisit [This Page](https://freecodecamp.org/challenges/get-set-for-our-dynamic-web-application-projects).

Here are the specific user stories you should implement for this project:

## User Story:
>1. As an unauthenticated user, I can view all bars in my area.

>2. As an authenticated user, I can add myself to a bar to indicate I am going there tonight.

>3. As an authenticated user, I can remove myself from a bar if I no longer want to go there.

>4. As an unauthenticated user, when I login I should not have to search again.


## Hint:
Try using the **[Yelp API](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/overview)** to find venues in the cities your users search for. If you use Yelp's API, be sure to mention so in your app

### Note
In this project I do not use a Framework as Frontend, takes time to get a response.

For this Project, I tried to get a code more modular, clean and easy to understand.
